--1.	Define and explain DDL and DML. Give two examples of each.
/*
DDL - Data Defintion Language is used to create, define and delete database and its structures(create, alter, drop, truncate)
create database databaseName; drop database databaseName
-- DML - Data Manipulation Language is used to manage database and its structures(insert, update, delete) 
insert into tableName values (name varchar(10), age int)
delete employees
where empID = 2
*/
--2.	Write a query to create a table Employees with columns: EmpID (INT, PRIMARY KEY), Name (VARCHAR(50)), Salary (DECIMAL(10,2)).
create table Employees (EmpID int primary key, [name] varchar(50), salary decimal(10,2))
--3.	Insert three records into the Employees table using the INSERT INTO statement.
insert into Employees values (1, 'Bill', 2000), (2, 'John', 2500), (3, 'Ann', 3000)

where EmpID = 1
--5.	Delete a record from the Employees table where EmpID = 2.
delete Employees
where EmpID = 2
--6.	Explain the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE with examples.
/*

create table Departments (DeptID int, DeptName varchar(20), constraint Pk_deptID primary key (DeptID))
create table employees (EmpID int, Employee varchar(20), constraint Fk_EmpID foreign key(EmpID) references Departments(DeptID))

alter table employee
alter column salary float
--17.	Drop the column Department from the Employees table using ALTER TABLE.

--20.	Write a query to remove the Departments table completely from the database.
drop table departments

--insert into employees values (1, 'Bill', 1), (2, 'John', 2), (3, 'Ann', FALSE), (4, 'Kate', FALSE), (5, 'Alex', TRUE)

--23.Create a stored procedure that inserts a new employee record into the Employees table.
create procedure spGetEmployees
@name varchar(15)
@department varchar(15)
@position varchar(15)
@salary int
as
begin
	insert into employees (name, department, position, salary) values (@name, @department, @position, @salary)
end

--24.Write a query that creates a backup table Employees_Backup with the same structure as Employees

from employees
